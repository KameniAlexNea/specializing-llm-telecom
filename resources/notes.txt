TeleQnA
Introduction
TeleQnA is a comprehensive dataset tailored to assess the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of telecommunications. It encompasses 10,000 multiple-choice questions distributed across five distinct categories:

Lexicon: This category comprises 500 questions that delve into the realm of general telecom terminology and definitions.

Research overview: Comprising 2,000 questions, this category provides a broad overview of telecom research, spanning a wide spectrum of telecom-related topics.

Research publications: With 4,500 questions, this category contains detailed inquiries regarding multi-disciplanary research in telecommunications, drawing from a variety of sources such as transactions and conferences proceedings.

Standards overview: This category consists of 1,000 questions related to summaries of standards from multiple standarization bodies like 3GPP and IEEE.

Standards specifications: With 2,000 questions, this category explores the technical specifications and practical implementations of telecommunications systems, leveraging information from standardization bodies like 3GPP and IEEE.

For more in-depth information about the dataset and the generation process, please refer to our paper by following this link. To prevent inadvertent data contamination with models trained using GitHub data, we have implemented a password protection measure for unzipping the dataset. The password is teleqnadataset.
