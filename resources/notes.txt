Specializing Large Language Models for Telecom Networks by ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge
The dataset shared with the participants is composed by multiple choice questions related to 3GPP standards included in the TeleQnA. TeleQnA is a comprehensive dataset tailored to assess the knowledge of LLMs in the field of telecommunications.

It encompasses 1827 multiple-choice questions distributed across two distinct categories:

Standards overview: This category consists of 318 questions related to summaries of standards from 3GPP standards.
Standards specifications: With 1509 questions, this category explores the technical specifications and practical implementations of telecommunications systems, leveraging information from 3GPP documents.
The 1827 MCQs are also divided in 1461 and 366 questions that compose the train and test1 sets.

For more in-depth information about the dataset and the generation process, please refer to [2].

Each question is represented in JSON format, comprising five distinct fields:

Question: This field consists of a string that presents the question associated with a specific concept within the telecommunications domain.
Options: This field comprises a set of strings representing the various answer options.
Answer: This field contains a string that adheres to the format ’option ID: Answer’ and presents the correct response to the question. A single option is correct; however, options may include choices like “All of the Above” or “Both options 1 and 2”.
Explanation: This field encompasses a string that clarifies the reasoning behind the correct answer.
Category: This field includes a label identifying the source category (e.g., lexicon, research overview, etc.).

TeleQnA
Introduction
TeleQnA is a comprehensive dataset tailored to assess the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of telecommunications. It encompasses 10,000 multiple-choice questions distributed across five distinct categories:

Lexicon: This category comprises 500 questions that delve into the realm of general telecom terminology and definitions.

Research overview: Comprising 2,000 questions, this category provides a broad overview of telecom research, spanning a wide spectrum of telecom-related topics.

Research publications: With 4,500 questions, this category contains detailed inquiries regarding multi-disciplanary research in telecommunications, drawing from a variety of sources such as transactions and conferences proceedings.

Standards overview: This category consists of 1,000 questions related to summaries of standards from multiple standarization bodies like 3GPP and IEEE.

Standards specifications: With 2,000 questions, this category explores the technical specifications and practical implementations of telecommunications systems, leveraging information from standardization bodies like 3GPP and IEEE.
